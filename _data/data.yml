    I am an experience senior developer in a data intensive area of Northwestern Mutual, and interested in shifting my role to a more data focused one.

    I've spent the last 8 years in the Managed Investments space at NM, primarily working primarily working as a team lead in the master data management project for investment data for the company's general account.  

    Serving in roles that require at least 30% of my time on data analysis (SQL Server applications) has led me to desire more of this type of work.
